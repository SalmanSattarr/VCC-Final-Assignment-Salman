RATIONALE FOR USING GPL V3.0

Using the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 (GPLv3) for your GitHub projects can offer several benefits, depending on your project's goals and requirements. Here are some potential advantages of choosing GPLv3 for your GitHub repositories:

1.    Open Source Collaboration:
        GPLv3 is a strong copyleft license that ensures the code and any modifications made to it remain open source. By using GPLv3, you encourage collaboration and contributions from the community, as anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code under the same license terms.

2.    Protecting Freedom and Sharing:
        GPLv3 promotes the principles of software freedom by ensuring that users have the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the software. It helps protect the rights of users and contributors by requiring that any derivative works also be licensed under GPLv3, thereby fostering a culture of sharing and collaboration.

3.    Preventing Proprietary Forks:
        The strong copyleft nature of GPLv3 ensures that any modifications or derivative works based on your project must also be licensed under GPLv3. This prevents others from creating proprietary versions of your software and helps maintain the project's open source nature.

4.    Building a Strong Community:
        By releasing your project under GPLv3, you signal your commitment to openness, transparency, and collaboration. This can attract like-minded developers and users who value these principles, leading to the growth of a strong and supportive community around your project.

5.    Legal Protections and Compliance:
        GPLv3 includes explicit terms and conditions that define how the software can be used, modified, and distributed. By using GPLv3, you provide clear guidelines for users and contributors, which can help prevent legal disputes and ensure compliance with open source licensing requirements.

6.    Access to Existing Ecosystem:
        Many open source projects and libraries are licensed under GPLv3 or compatible licenses. By choosing GPLv3 for your project, you ensure compatibility with existing GPLv3-licensed codebases, making it easier to integrate and leverage existing open source resources.
